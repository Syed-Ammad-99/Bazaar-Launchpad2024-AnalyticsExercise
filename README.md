## Insights and Recommendations 

### Distribution of Orders by Warehouse: 

The data suggests that warehouses ID 3 and ID 2 handle a significant portion of the orders, and 
strategies could be developed to manage the workload or to increase efficiency in other warehouses.  

### How to Increase Customers Spending on Shopping: 

Customers spending can be increase by offering bundle package with mirror discount on specifically 
Complementary Products (This means product which are used together to achieve a common purpose). 

Example:    

Paint box and paint brush can be sell together by offering some discount in it, so if customer wants to 
buy paint box, he/she will attract and buy paint brush as well. 

Some more complementary product are mention below. 
1. Smartphones and Cases 
2. Printers and Ink Cartridges 
3. Coffee Machines and Coffee Pods/Beans 
4. Bicycles and Helmets 
5. Cereal and Milk 

### Sales Revenue Over Time: 

The spike on February 3th could be due to a successful marketing campaign, a seasonal event, or other 
factors that temporarily boosted sales. The subsequent decline suggests that the factors contributing to 
the spike were short-lived. Understanding the reasons behind such spikes and drops in sales is crucial for 
making informed business decisions. 

### Total Revenue by Stores: 

The uniformity in low revenue across all stores as depicted in this graph is unusual and only 1 store took 
responsibility of major part of revenue is alarming. When each store receive order frequently then 
revenue will be much higher and workload, inventory will also be organized.
