## Objective
This task demonstrates SQL querying, analytical thinking, and data visualization skills to derive insights and recommendations for improving business performance. We begin with a examination of the some SQL query, followed by an in-depth analysis of the distribution of orders by warehouse and store, and identification of top-selling items.

## Dataset Description
 The attacheddataset contains information about sales transactions including order date, order number, warehouse ID, store ID, item ID, amount per unit, ordered quantity, item discount, and expected delivery date.
 
## Tasks:
 
 1. Data Exploration
 ● Write SQL queries for the following tasks and provide a brief summary of key findings including:
 ● Total number of orders
 ● Total sales revenue
 ● Average order quantity
 ● Distribution of orders by warehouse and store
 ● Topselling items

 2. Analytical Questions
 ● Answerthe following analytical questions using SQL queries:
     1. What is the overall discount rate (average discount per item sold)?
     2. Which warehouse has the highest average order value (total sales revenue divided by number of orders)?
     3. What is the total revenue generated by each store?
     4. Identify the top 5 customers (based on total amount spent).
     5. Calculate the month-over-month growth rate of sales revenue.
     6. Determine the percentage of orders that were canceled.
       
 3. Data Visualization
 ● Chooseadata visualization tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn).
 ● Create visualizations to present insights from the data exploration and analytical questions.
 ● Visualizations should include:
   ● Timeseries plot of sales revenue over time.
   ● Barchart showing total revenue by store.
   ● Piechart illustrating the distribution of orders by warehouse.
   ● Anyadditional visualizations you deem relevant to showcase insights.

 5. Insights and Recommendations
 ● Basedonyour findings from the data exploration, analytical questions, and visualizations, provide insights into the business performance.
 ● Suggest actionable recommendations for the company to optimize sales and improve overall performance.
 ● Consider factors such as warehouse/store performance, customer behavior, and sales trends.

## Data Exploration

### Total number of orders: 
This query will count the distinct order numbers from the table sample1 to get the total number of orders.

![Total order number](https://github.com/Syed-Ammad-99/Bazaar-Launchpad2024-AnalyticsExercise/blob/main/screenshots/Total%20order%20number.png)

By using COUNT(DISTINCT order_number) This function counts the unique instances of order_number in the table, ensuring that each order is only counted once, even if it appears multiple times.

### Total sales revenue:
The result of this query will be a single value representing the total sales revenue, excluding cancelled or invalid orders.

![Total sales revenue](https://github.com/Syed-Ammad-99/Bazaar-Launchpad2024-AnalyticsExercise/blob/main/screenshots/Total%20sales%20revenue.png)

First the WHERE clause filters the data to exclude orders with a status of ‘CANCELLED’ or ‘INVALID’ in table sample1 then SUM(amount_per_unit * ordered_quantity - item_discount) query calculates the total sales revenue by multiplying the amount per unit by the ordered quantity for each item, subtracting any discount, and then summing up these values for all orders. 






## Insights and Recommendations 

### Distribution of Orders by Warehouse: 

The data suggests that warehouses ID 3 and ID 2 handle a significant portion of the orders, and 
strategies could be developed to manage the workload or to increase efficiency in other warehouses.  

### How to Increase Customers Spending on Shopping: 

Customers spending can be increase by offering bundle package with mirror discount on specifically 
Complementary Products (This means product which are used together to achieve a common purpose). 

Example:    

Paint box and paint brush can be sell together by offering some discount in it, so if customer wants to 
buy paint box, he/she will attract and buy paint brush as well. 

Some more complementary product are mention below. 
1. Smartphones and Cases 
2. Printers and Ink Cartridges 
3. Coffee Machines and Coffee Pods/Beans 
4. Bicycles and Helmets 
5. Cereal and Milk 

### Sales Revenue Over Time: 

The spike on February 3th could be due to a successful marketing campaign, a seasonal event, or other 
factors that temporarily boosted sales. The subsequent decline suggests that the factors contributing to 
the spike were short-lived. Understanding the reasons behind such spikes and drops in sales is crucial for 
making informed business decisions.

### Total Revenue by Stores: 

The uniformity in low revenue across all stores as depicted in this graph is unusual and only 1 store took 
responsibility of major part of revenue is alarming. When each store receive order frequently then 
revenue will be much higher and workload, inventory will also be organized.
